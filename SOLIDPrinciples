what is SOLID and how does it help us write better code?
Simply put, design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. 
Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!

The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles:


Single Responsibility
Open/Closed
Liskov Substitution
Interface Segregation
Dependency Inversion
